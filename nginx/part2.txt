Part B: DevOps Research Task – Infrastructure Setup & CLI Flow for Backend.im
1. Proposed Architecture & Reasoning

The goal is a one-command deployment flow from local code to live backend on Backend.im, using mostly open-source tools. The architecture should be lightweight, modular, and require minimal manual configuration.

High-Level Architecture:

[Local Dev Machine]
       |
       |  (Claude Code CLI / AI tool triggers)
       v
[CI/CD Orchestrator / Local CLI Scripts]
       |
       v
[Dockerized App + Nginx Proxy / Reverse Proxy]
       |
       v
[Backend.im Deployment Environment]
       |
       v
[Live Application]


Reasoning:

Using Docker ensures consistent environment regardless of local machine.

Nginx handles routing and reverse proxying for multiple services.

The Claude Code CLI acts as the entry point for developers to push and deploy code.

Optional GitOps-style workflow using a simple Git repository to track deployments (still minimal setup).

2. Tools or Frameworks
Tool/Framework	Purpose	Why
Docker / docker-compose	Containerize backend services	Consistent environments, widely used, easy to integrate
Nginx	Reverse proxy & routing	Lightweight, simple templating, handles multiple apps
Claude Code CLI	Deployment trigger	Primary interface for devs to push code
Git	Version control	Standard in dev workflows; optionally triggers deployments
Open-source CI/CD tools (like Drone CI, GitHub Actions)	Automate build & deployment if desired	Lightweight, integrates with CLI tools, free tiers available
Env files (.env)	Configuration	Keeps secrets/config separate and reusable
Bash scripts / Makefile	Local deployment automation	Simplifies “one-command” flow
3. Local Setup Flow

Step-by-step flow for a developer:

Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

Install prerequisites: Docker, Docker Compose, Claude Code CLI

Configure environment: Copy .env.example to .env and set values

Build & test locally:

docker-compose up --build


Run AI CLI deployment:

claude-code deploy


This triggers Docker build, pushes container, updates Nginx config if necessary, and deploys to Backend.im

Verify deployment: Access live app via assigned URL

5. Where Minimal Custom Code is Required

CLI integration: Minimal wrapper script to call Docker builds and trigger deployment

Nginx templating: Simple script to generate configs for each service

Env management: Simple parsing script to inject .env values into containers

Optional post-deploy health checks: small script to verify deployment status
